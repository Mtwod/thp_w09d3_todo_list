# THP project of the day : JS AJAX with rails, Gmail-like

Today, we train on AJAX from an app done by someone else. We will work on a dynamic display with AJAX in addition to a simple html display with Rails.


Here is the [link to my app on Heroku](https://mw-todolist.herokuapp.com/ "MW's ToDoListApp")

## Objectives

1. Code the view for a display similar to Gmail with a mail list on the left and an email content on the right (empty when landing on page or refresh)

2. Add a button to create a new email with Faker, make it appear on HTML and with AJAX at the end of the list with its object as content

3. When the user click on one email, its content is displayed on the right. Then add two buttons (disabled at first) to delete and mark as read/unread

4. Add the delete/destroy option with rails and AJAX

5. Mark the email as read on click, and add the possibility to return to its unread state through the button 'mark as unread'

6. If the user has to click on the email's object text to display the content, code with AJAX a mean to do it when the user click wherever inside the box (div for example) where the text is.
